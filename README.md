# LuaSnip-LaTeX-Snippets

A set of preconfigured snippets for LaTeX for the snippet engine [LuaSnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip).

## Idea
I would like to make the above plugin work with the texlab language server for LaTeX, instead of vimtex.
This is mostly an exercise in neovim and Lua, and may never actually work.

In fact, it seems that texlab does not currently support all the features required to do this.
